# v1.0.0
## what's working ?
- Can fetch country data from remote API
- Can store in local file, if proper file path is provided
- Generally will return fetched data in form of `Map<String, Map<String, String>>`, holding detailed data for all countries
- Feel free to process received data more :wink:
